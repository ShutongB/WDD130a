      <h3>- Trending Clothing of the season: 
        Sweaters: One of the top street styler’s favorite items is definitely knits. As a year around wardrobe staples, knits are perfect transitional pieces to take you from fall’s chill to winter’s colder temperatures. In spring 2023 season, we see more soft and fluffy sweaters that match perfectly  with sequined skirts, tailored corduroys, minis; wrap a sweater over your shoulders or layer it under a cozy jacket. You name it! 
        Blazers:
        -	Slouchy, oversized blazers were all the rage at Valentino and even Chanel opted for relaxed-fit versions of its trademark bouclé jackets in playful pinks. If you're a die-hard sharp tailoring gal, luckily Victoria Beckham came through with simple tailored blazers that acted as mini dresses.
        -	
        Denim:
        Designers made denim sexy for SS23 – who'd have thought it? Asymmetric fitted shirts paired with soft brown co-ords at A.W.A.K.E. had a certain hippyish glam, whereas Bella Hadid's buckle Givenchy buckle bra exuded utilitarian sultriness.

      <h3>Jewelry Trends:
        It is easy to get caught up in revamping your wardrobe to fit the season’s latest trends. But, remember, jewelry is often what makes and completes an outfit. To keep your fashion simple, grab your favorite black sweater or white button-down and shift your energy to focus on the jewelry trends for 2023. Here if the three biggest jewelry trends expected to shine throughout 2023.
        Cuffs:
        A silver or gold cuff is the perfect example of a way to make a subtle statement with just one piece. Cuff bracelets are proving themselves to be the easiest way to elevate any look. 
        Superior silver:
        Silver hoop 
        Gold has been associated with first place for long enough, it’s silver’s time to shine. Oversized silver hoops are another ’80s trend but they look incredibly modern when paired with 2023’s runway trends. For everyday wear, consider downsizing the hoop size (your ears will thank you) and leave the big guys for special occasions.
        Beads necklaces
        Thinly beaded necklaces are the perfect trend for layering experts. Whether you’re stacking multiple strands of the same beads, mixing and matching, or just letting a singular strand speak for itself, this boho trend is a casual way to accessorize. Take notes from Blumarine, the totally Y2 K-inspired brand, and add a charm to a beaded strand, or get inspired by Coach’s quirky decision to add unusual objects to a long strand like a sports whistle. You don’t need to wear a flower crown or long skirt for beads to work with your outfit.
